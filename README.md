# The Planner:

The purpose of the planner is to help the user organize events, which are saved to a database. It will also serve as a center for linking to other resources used by the team, such as other pages. More details in the plan google document.

## Basic Project Plan
We want to create a productivity website where people can create checklists, calendars, use customized calculators, and look at the stock market.

Our target audience is Students looking to have a one-stop website with helpful resources. We want to deploy the website for anyone to see.

**Final project plan** <br>
- Before and up to the AP Exam: a single webpage is developed per CB unit. Sometimes there will be multiple pages. Why AP? It's a very direct, useful topic that's on our minds right now. *This will not be just minilabs!*, but we will still work on the minilabs. It will be all our work in applying the knowledge of each unit to a webpage. This will promote collaboration by having everyone work on the same web page and therefore be more open to helping each other out since everyone will notice each others errors and successes.
- - CS algorithms to code, for example something with inheritance and polymorphism, will come from ourselves, Udemy, Lantsberger, the Barron's Book, and Runstone. We *can* afford to come up with these on the spot and work on one over the course of 1-2 days since they are simple enough. The goal here is practice and efficiency!
- Secondary content and content after AP Exam:
- **Specialized AP Computer Science A Productivity App** <~~ add your names and stuff 2 do here:
- Aidan: does database stuff and hosting on AWS (need to contact Andrew Pegg). Currently on Heroku as a substitute. Need to make a directory for minilabs. Fragments as well.
**Details About the Productivity App:** <br>
- Final grade calculator 
- Sections for easter eggs.
- Notes can be take which will be stored in a database (this location can store TPT stuff)
- Checklist in React.
- Study plan in spring. The study plan will store a plan using a REST API organized by time until the test and study techniques, with the techniques changing based on how much time there is left to study. The REST API data will then be organized in HTML via a table using objects.
- Calendar for deadlines
- Currently we are hosting through Heroku. The plan is to learn how to deploy using AWS.
