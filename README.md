## Note: the code currently is not online. You must pull and run it on the local host to see anything. 
## Basic Project Plan
We want to create a productivity website where people can create checklists, calendars, use customized calculators, and look at the stock market.

Our target audience is Students looking to have a one-stop website with helpful resources. We want to deploy the website for anyone to see.

**Final project plan** <br>
- Before and up to the AP Exam: a single webpage is developed per CB unit. Sometimes there will be multiple pages. Why AP? It's a very direct, useful topic that's on our minds right now. *This will not be just minilabs!*, but we will still work on the minilabs. It will be all our work in applying the knowledge of each unit to a webpage. This will promote collaboration by having everyone work on the same web page and therefore be more open to helping each other out since everyone will notice each others errors and successes.
- Secondary content and content after AP Exam:
- **Productivity App** <~~ add your names and stuff 2 do here:
